# Data-Analysis-With-SQL

Used SQL to answer business questions for the fictious Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company. I was asked to make a presentation for the marketing department to help them determine their strategy for 2020. 

Wrote SQL commands in PostgreSQL including WHERE and HAVING clasues, CASE statements, JOINS and CTEs.
